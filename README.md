# WorldeAnalysis

WordleAnalysis is a hobby project that helps understand information theory through the lens of the recently popular word game, Wordle and model a "fast wordle solver" 


# Useful Files
1. wordle_faster.py: a fast wordle word performance calculator (33,143,049 games played in <20 mins).
2. guess_your_word.py: a naive program to play Wordle with answer as any 5 letter English Word. 
3. wordle_faster_n2.py (work in progress): tries to exhaustively solve wordle, currently using 2 depth.

[!IMPORTANT]
The .py files have their corresponding processed datasets. All wordle games were played using wordle_dict.txt. If use of other dictionaries is wanted, generate your own data using the python files.
